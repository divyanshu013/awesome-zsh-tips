## What isÂ Zsh?

`Zsh` ([Z shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell)) is a unix shell (just like `bash`) with lots of extended features and customizations. If you like `bash`, you'll love `zsh` ðŸ˜‰.

It works really well on both linux and mac OS and I use it on both. The following tips should also work fine in windows but if something is amiss please feel free to send a PR ðŸ™‚.
