# Awesome ZSH Tips

Learn a new ZSH tip in less than 30 seconds

## What isÂ Zsh?

`Zsh` ([Z shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell)) is a unix shell (just like `bash`) with lots of extended features and customizations. If you like `bash`, you'll love `zsh` ðŸ˜‰.

It works really well on both linux and mac OS and I use it on both. The following tips should also work fine in windows but if something is amiss please feel free to send a PR ðŸ™‚.

## Setup

1. Install `zsh` for your OS
2. Install [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh#getting-started)
3. I use [hyper](https://hyper.is/) terminal because of its extensibility and availablity on both mac OS and linux. You may use any terminal application of your choice.
